## General Information
Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset. The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module. We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc. The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The R-squared value of the train set is 83.52% 

The R-squared value of the Test set  80.59%

Which explains that 80% of variance in target variable is explained by input variables.

We can conclude that the bike demands for the BoomBikes is company is dependent on the temperature,windspeed,year and season whether it is a workingday or not.

In summer months also show low rental levels, a strong marketing strategy for the first 6 months of the year can assist in driving up the rental numbers.

Rentals were more in 2019 than 2018 which suggests that over time more people would be exposed to this idea and there has to a strong analysis done to retain the repeat customers.
